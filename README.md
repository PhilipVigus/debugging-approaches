# Debugging approaches

This project contains files created as I worked through the 'debugging approaches' exercise during week 1 of the Makers Academy course.

The exercise took me through a number of different pieces of code, asking me to debug them as necessary.

I recorded my work on the exercise as a two-part screen cap, the parts of which can be found here:
